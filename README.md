## Devfolio Brand Assets

  

Find everything you need to showcase the Devfolio brand.

The following guidelines have been created to help other organsiations and people use our brands and assets, which include our logos, names, content and trademarks.

  

The following Assets are included;

  

1. `Logo + Text` assets involve the Devfolio 'D' logo with the 'Devfolio' text without any background.

It has three variants -

- `White`<img src ="Logo + Text - White/Devfolio - White.png" style="width: 100px; background-color: #2F3437; padding: 8px 10px 8px 10px; border-radius: 8px;margin-left: 20px; ">

- `Dark` <img src ="Logo + Text - Dark/Devfolio - Dark.svg" style="width: 100px; margin-left: 20px;">

- `Coloured` <img src ="Logo + Text - Colored/Devfolio - Normal.svg" style="width: 100px; margin-left: 20px;">

2. `Logo` has the classic coloured 'D' logo in all its glory.<img src ="Logo/Logo.svg" style="width: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">

  

3. `Devfolio Square` involves a white 'D' logo with the signature blue background. <img src ="Devfolio Square/Square.png" style="width: 30px; margin-left: 20px;">

If you're using Devfolio's D as a profile picture and the D doesn't seem to be centered, try using `Devfolio Square/Logo-Square centred.png`
